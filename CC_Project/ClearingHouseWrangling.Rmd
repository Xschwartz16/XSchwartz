## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# demo_data <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/e0td697qjb3l9hc/demo%20file.csv?dl=1") %>%
#   clean_names() %>%
#   rename(temp_id = i_temp_id)

clearinghouse_data <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/rwctyw777fodry2/002115st_398963_DETLRPT_SE_02242020121415_002115se0019.csv?dl=1") %>%
  clean_names()
```

``` {r cars}

clearWrangle <- clearinghouse_data%>%
  filter(college_name=="AMHERST COLLEGE"& degree_major_1!="")%>%
  select(c(1,18,20,22),)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
